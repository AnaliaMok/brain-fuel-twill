# Brain Fuel - Twill

Brain Fuel is a fake company name I use for experimental projects such as this one.

## Technologies

* Laravel 5.8
* [Lando](https://docs.devwithlando.io/) - for environment spin-up and management

### Packages
* [Twill](https://twill.io/) - Laravel-based CMS
* [Telescope](https://laravel.com/docs/5.8/telescope) - Debugging

## Setup
1. Clone this repo
2. If you like to use Lando, simply run the following in the root of this directory:
  * `lando start`
  * `lando setup` This will handle the typical Laravel project setup steps.
